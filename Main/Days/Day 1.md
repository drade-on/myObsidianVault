First entry ! 
Generations of tomorrow! 
I am sitting in a cafe after a lost match of Go contemplating what should I do with my life since Ive spent like 21/72 of it

I wish for you to not think about it
I donk know about what media you consume, but if 'do the best you can now' is still an overused trope, I wish you could understand how much it hurts right now and how much I wish you will avoid that

I should take care of myself more
I should groom and shower daily 
I should clip my nails daily
I should make this git repo part private
Id rather do this than play any game :3
